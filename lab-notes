Active Counter Measures Threat Hunting Exercise Walkthrough
===========================================================

Lab Format:  

We were presented a problem and given a few moments to try to come up with the solution ourselves.

Then a hint was given to help with some sugested commands.  

Finally, the exact commands were given and a complete wakthrough of the solution was given.  

J3 plugin needs installed to hash certificates since Zeek does not hash by default

=====
LAB 1
=====

To retrieve the src and dst IP addresses of the longest connection times in the traffic:  
> Super long connection times can be indictative of an established malicious connection and can be a source of adding major points to the risk score. **Define cutoffs!**   


```bash
cat conn.log | bro-cut duration id.orig_h id.resp_h | sort -k 1 -rn | head -10
```

> note: to get information about the packet capture, utilize tcpdump

```bash
tcpdump -tttt -n -r <filename> | awk 'NR==1; END{print}'

Find the longest talk-time (datamash):  

```bash 
cat conn.log | bro-cut duration id.orig_h id.resp_h | grep -v '-' | datamash -g 2,3 sum 1 | sort -k 3 -rn | head -10
```
grep -v '-' removes some fields that might have bad characters and no connection duration because of a port rejection etc. 

datamash -g 2,3 sum 1 means to match on the ip addresses and see if there are any that are the same, if they are, add the connection durations for those ip address matches

sort -k 3 -rn sorts the 3rd column in reverse order (default is lowest to highest)

head -10 lists the top 10 values


## Identifying Beaconing Activity

**Finding the Top 3 as Possible Beacons**  
```bash
cat conn.log | bro-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h orig_bytes | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
```

The important piece here is the uniq -c --> this takes the unique ip addresses, but doesn't eliminate any, instead it combines them into one and counts their occurances. This gives us things that are speaking **frequently** in the network. Very useful.  

> Investigating the 192.168.88.2 host further to check to see if it is truly a beacon. 

```bash
cat conn.log | bro-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h orig_bytes | grep 192.168.88.2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
```

## Hunting for Possible C2 Activity

Counting up unique subdomains belonging to a single domain! So cool...  

```bash
cat dns.log | bro-cut query | sort | uniq | rev | cut -d "." -f 1-2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
```

# Getting It All Done w/RITA

rita show-databases                  simply shows the loaded databases
rita show-long-connections lab1      lists the longest connections, pipe to head to see the top 10, or cut, however.
rita show-beacons lab1		     shows the beaconing activity and gives it a score 0-1 with 1 being a perfect beacon
rita show-exploded-dns lab1 	     shows the domains with the most subdomains, and lists how many there are of each

any rita command -H creates a very nice view of the data.
