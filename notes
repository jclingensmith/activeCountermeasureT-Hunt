# Job Posting Information

ACM does not post job openings anywhere - applicants are considered based on referral.

# Understanding Phishing Email Mentality

Change mentality of the user around phishing emails. Provide reward incentives for being the first person to flag or tag an email as a phish. 

## Lecture Logistics


5 modules, 45 minutes each
20 minute break after module 2 and 4



# Basics of C2

Theme: "Why Do Attackers Infect Networks?"


1) Historically - Mass Propagation
2) Now - Monetization!   "Bad Guy with a Business Model"
	- own internal systems

Direct call-backs to origin IP makes attribution too easy, so setup C2. 

Host "checks in" with the C2 server to see if there are any commands waiting for the host. If yes: execute command.

**Email makes a great C2 server!**

## Problem Space

Dwell-time is on average about 6 months and orgs typically discover breach from a 3rd party. 

Reference: 2019 Verizon Breach Report

0 companies that had PoS device compromise were self-discovered breaches.

Need to cut down dwell-time

**threat hunting** = understand normal internal network patterns to detect bad actors

## State of Security Today

tooling today typically surround preventing access and incident response
- RITA identifies the gap of detecting when controls fail, and need to trigger incident response.

**syslog was not designed for security** 
  - designed in 1988
  - 2 components (type of log entry aka 'facility', and severity)
  - **no** security related log entry, the severity is not related to security
  - top level of severity '2/critical' = failure in the systems primary applicatino e.g. crash.

**Hunting C2 Not Enough**
 - Randomware attacks, logic bombs, self-propagating worms - some forms of profit do not require a C2 server.

## Where to Start

Full PCAP - highest level of detail, expensive to store the data. May limit organization to hour or two timeframes. **C2 may be activated every few hours** 
Zeek - can capture larger timeframes with less packet-level detail (essentially netflow)

Analyze communications in pairs (ignoring internal to internal, sometimes makes sense since system-to-system communications within the network can generate a lot of false positivs e.g. the use of powershell)

**Suricata**  

C2 signature of DNScat vs normal traffic sometimes the two look VERY similar.

 
IDS/IPS is not dead and can be useful, but struggles with identifying unique/custom/adverse C2 channel traffic.

# What to Look for First  

1) Persistent Connections
   - A google search is fine, a google search every 3 minutes with the exact same query is suspicious.
   - thinking in a time-based format is useful, but can also think in **frequency-based** constraints to the data.  
   - Easy to identify persistent connections over a long period of time (but beaconing is a bit more difficult)
   - **Beacon** = short, repetative signal generation. 
   - R statistical suite, datamash (common tools used to identify)
   - K-means clustering - works to identify constant-rate beaconing.
   - Jitter is missed by K-means clustering. **Jitter** = variation in the interval time. 
   - Session-size analysis helps to address this problem, more on Jitter later in the lecture.
   - Session-size --> when the C2 issues no command, that session duration is typically always the same. Very indicative. Only differs when the C2 server activates a command to be run.   
> Attackers have figured out how to maintain a connection to C2 server in random intervals, even when no command is issued, this is used to make the connnection look like a typical connection. "Top Talkers" is now useless, and there only needs to be a few beacons per day. 
   - Lab will address ways to still detect this. 
   - Beacon activity is rare, but not necessarily evil. 

2) Signs of Automation
   - 



3) IP 2 IP communications
   - C2 can jump ports and protocols! Immediate re-establishment of connections. 


# Investigating Beaconing

Is the IP on a blacklist? Why?

Domain < 7 days old?  
> Attackers register the domain and do C2/spam etc and then refund the purchase.  

Signature Analysis  

Type of Protocol  

# Threat Hunting Process

Goals: Identify Persistent Connections (typically internal -> external)  
Subgoal: Be able to justify each connection as business-relevant  

Why start with persistent connections?   
  - Threat intelligence feeds rely on the same malware being pushed to everyone
  - Attackers want to monitize their engagement so custom malware coming from original IP addresses is missed.

> IP addresses can host multipe website. Blacklisting a single IP address can result in multiple legitimate sites being blocked. 

  - Digital Ocean/Google/Amazon getting blocked. 
  - Origin of intelligence can sometimes be questionable. 

## Technique vs. Methodology  

Brocut and grep are solid technical tools that may not scale super well. The approach is the methodology. 

The ability to manually verify an automated solution is valuable, so knowing the technique is worth. 

## Red Team vs Bad Guys

Bad guys typically have an objective beyond accessing the network and setting up a C2. Bad guys need to MONITIZE. 

Red team doesn't care, just needs to demonstrate successful execution. 

> If you can catch the red team, you won't have a problem with the monitizing bad guys. 

# UDP  

Connection duration is calculated based on how frequently the UDP packets travel from same srcIP,dstIP and srcPort,dstPort.

# TCP  

Fairly straightforward for connection duration.  

# ICMP & GRE  

Much more complicated. 


# Threat Hunting Air-Gapped Networks  

> Creating profiles for each device on the network to identify what the endpoints interacts with, and on average how much data is sent from the device. 

Actually establish that the system is airgapped.
